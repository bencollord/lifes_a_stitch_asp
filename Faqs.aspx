        <h3>Do I need to provide my own clothing to be embroidered?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Nope! Life's a Stitch now offers a full line of clothing. However, if you would like us to embroider something of your own, we'd be glad to take care of you.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Is there a minimum or maximum order size?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Not at all. We will give you the same fast and high quality service no matter how small or large the order (within the realm of possibility, of course).</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Can I have something other than clothing embroidered or printed?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Yes! We will do anything from coffee cups and mouse pads all the way to more unique things like the upholstry of your car (check out our gallery).</p>
